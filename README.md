Objective: Manage stock items for a hypothetical store named "ONE MALL."
GUI Elements:
Labels: Used for displaying text instructions.
Entry Widgets: Allow user input for item details (name, price, quantity, discount, category).
Buttons: Perform various actions like adding, deleting, searching, displaying all records, updating, and exiting.
Database Integration:

Uses MySQL database (badola) hosted locally (localhost) with credentials (root and password 'PASSWORD').
Operations include adding new items, deleting items, searching for items, updating item details, and displaying all records.

Classes and Methods:

stock class (inherits from Frame): Manages the GUI layout and functionality.
Initialization (__init__ method): Sets up GUI elements (labels, entries, buttons) using grid layout.
Methods:
add: Adds a new item to the database.
dele: Deletes an item from the database.
search: Searches for an item in the database and displays its details.
display: Opens a new window (cdata class from stock2) to display all records.
close: Exits the application.
modify: Updates details of an existing item in the database.
cdata class (from stock2): Likely manages the display of all records, but its implementation details are not provided in the snippet.
Functional Flow
Adding an Item (add method):

Takes inputs (item name, price, quantity, discount, category) from the user.
Inserts these values into the stock table in the database.
Displays a message confirming successful record insertion or an error message if insertion fails.
Deleting an Item (dele method):

Deletes an item based on the item name provided by the user.
Shows a message confirming deletion if successful or notifies if the item is not found.
Searching for an Item (search method):

Retrieves details of an item based on the item name entered by the user.
Displays retrieved details in respective entry widgets.
Enables the update button (b6) to allow modification of the retrieved item.
Displaying All Items (display method):

Opens a new window (root1) to display all records using the cdata class.
Modifying an Item (modify method):

Updates details of an existing item based on modifications made by the user.
Shows a message confirming successful update or notifies if the item is not found.
Exiting the Application (close method):

Closes the main application window (root) and exits the program.
GUI Layout and Design
Uses grid layout (grid) to arrange GUI elements (labels, entries, buttons) in rows and columns.
Buttons (b1 to b6) are configured with different colors and commands for specific operations.
Entry widgets (t1 to t5) allow user input for item details.
Conclusion
This project aims to provide a basic inventory management system using a graphical interface with Python's Tkinter library and MySQL for database operations. It covers essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing stock items in a retail environment.
